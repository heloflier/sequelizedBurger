# Burger 2: the SQL

Burger 2 is a further development on the 'Burger' node application essentially demonstrating the capabilities of the technologies employed. 

The user can go to the main page, where he can enter his/her preferred hamburger (which will be entered in a MySQL database); when done, he/she will have the option to devour it and add the name of the person who devoured it. When that happens, the burger's status will change in the database, and it will be cross-referenced with the person who devoured it. 

Finally, the burger will be visualized in the "devoured" column, in alphabetical order.
